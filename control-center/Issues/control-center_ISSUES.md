## Issues Ledger

| ID | Created | Title | Status | Owner | Evidence / Links | Resolution Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ISSUE-0001 | 2026-05-03 00:51 EDT | Superseded ControlBoard/TCC/MWIDE documents quarantined after Dashboard SSOT correction | Verified | Floyd | `.floyd/quarantine/2026-05-03/` plus `.floyd/quarantine/LEDGER.jsonl`; canonical replacement is `control-center/SSOT/control-center_SSOT.md` | Quarantine script output listed 17 `status: quarantined` entries; active SSOT rewritten with Dashboard monoapplication copy rule and beta gates. |
| ISSUE-0002 | 2026-05-03 15:35 EDT | Native Playwright delete flow reports xterm WebGL dispose warning and iframe sandbox warning | New | Floyd | `with-server-playwright-smoke` output: console warning `term.dispose() failed: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'onRequestRedraw')`; browser warning `iframe... allow-scripts and allow-same-origin... can escape its sandboxing` | Not remediated in this helper-blocker task; browser flow still returned `status: pass` and `pageerrors: []`. |

## Mandatory execution contract

For EACH requested item:
1. Show exact action taken
2. Show direct evidence (file/line/command/output)
3. Show verification result
4. Mark status only after proof

## Forbidden behaviors
- Declaring completion without evidence
- Collapsing multiple requested items into one vague summary
- Skipping failed steps without explicit blocker report
- Deleting instead of quarantining

## Required output structure
A) Requested items checklist
B) Per-item evidence ledger
C) Verification receipts
D) Completeness matrix

## Hard gate
If any requested item has no evidence row, final status MUST be INCOMPLETE.
